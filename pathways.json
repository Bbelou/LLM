This call is just the tip of the iceberg. But, we offer two key solutions: outbound and inbound sales agents. In terms of outbound, our AI sales agents handle automated cold outreach, qualify leads, schedule appointments, and follow up as well. For inbound operations, we build AI agents for customer service, appointment booking, virtual assistance, and much more. These agents can manage unlimited complex inquiries and tasks, at better rates and lower costs compared to an actual person. Now, which one of the proposed applications seems to interest you more?"
